# Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalksClub
#### Data Engineering involves the design, development, and management of systems and processes to collect, store, process, and analyze data. It encompasses various tasks, including data ingestion, transformation, storage, and retrieval, to ensure that data is available, accessible, and usable for analytical and operational purposes. Data Engineers give disoriented data orientation for Data Scientists, Analysts and Ml Engineers to while automating the data engineering process.Data Engineers work with large volumes of data, often in real-time or batch processing environments, and use tools and technologies such as databases, data warehouses, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, and big data frameworks to build robust and scalable data infrastructure. They collaborate closely with Data Scientists, Analysts, and other stakeholders to understand data requirements and deliver solutions that support data-driven decision-making and insights generation. Overall, Data Engineering plays a critical role in enabling organizations to leverage their data assets effectively and derive value from their data.

## 01-Docker-Terraform-GCP
#### 1.1 Docker : is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments, from development to production. Docker simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing applications by providing a unified interface for working with containers. 
##### Key features of Docker include:

 * Containerization: Docker enables developers to package their applications and dependencies into containers, which can then be deployed and run consistently across different environments.
*  Image-based: Docker uses images to create containers. Images are read-only templates that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
* Dockerfile: Docker uses a simple and declarative syntax called Dockerfile to define the steps needed to build an image. Dockerfiles specify the base image, environment variables, commands, and files to include in the image.
* Docker Engine: Docker Engine is the runtime environment for containers. It manages the lifecycle of containers, including starting, stopping, and monitoring them, as well as managing networking and storage.
* Docker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to define the services, dependencies, and configurations of the application, making it easy to manage complex deployments.
* Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service where users can store and share Docker images. It provides access to a vast repository of pre-built images that can be used as base images for building applications.
* Overall, Docker revolutionizes the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed by providing a standardized and efficient approach to containerization. It enables developers to build, ship, and run applications faster and more reliably, while also improving resource utilization and scalability.
